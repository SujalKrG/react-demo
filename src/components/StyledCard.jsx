        to heaven and come back alive and i should also assume that it won't
        take too much time or knowledge to view such a beautiful scene in our
        very own eyes... Likely its close to heaven and not exactly heaven coz i
        need to die to get to heaven and i dont think that i can ever achieve
        such a great position in my life that i cant even express the feelings
        for whats going to hPPEN in my life 
      </p>
    </div>
